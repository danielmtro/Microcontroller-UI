Lab 1 30/03/2022:

Members Present: Will, Daniel 
Missing members today: Henry

Tasks accomplished today:
Planned the modules that will be requried.

Task - 1

1. Serial Initialise (DONE)
2. Interrupt function
3. Write function (DONE)
4. Read function 

Task - 2

1. Design string handling function that takes in command and outputs specific

Potential design for a command 

L 0
L 1
W "string"
Help

S (0-9)

Where:
      L 0 refers to turning off the leds
      L 1 refers to turning on the leds
      S refers to operating the 7 seg and displaying a particular number that's specified after
      W sends out the string that follows the letter
      Help - displays everything the user can do.

Anything else triggers a writing to the serial port to say "error, invalid command"

2. LED module that changes on or off based on a variable

3. 7 seg module that changes the number based on a variable

4. Tweaking the write to serial char output 


Things decided for this week:
Everyone picks a module they wanna design - if its easy do another one. 
Let everyone know that you're doing the module so no one does it twice.
Let the group know when you're working on the file to avoid conflicts when merging

Communication Platform: Facebook Messenger (discord is for nerds)

Goals for next week:
Finish all the modules for exercise 1
Make a solid start on exercise 2
